            <p>How to activate Google's AMP and what they are Do you know the Accelerated Mobile Pages or AMP? This new
                format optimized for mobile devices has numerous advantages, one of them is the improvement of web

                to explain how to activate the AMP, configure these pages and everything that surrounds this Google

            <p>Tough Time Finding A Job? Consider Being A Delivery Driver There are times when it is very difficult to
                find a job. Depending on your level of education and experience, it can be downright impossible in
                certain parts of the country. That is why flexible jobs that help people find independent contract work
                are so important. It is why we have seen the rise of the so-called "Gig Economy".</p>

            <p>The icon is the first presentation of your app and maybe a bad design or a not so nice icon can make the
                user refuse to install your app. You should try to give professional and nice presentation to, at least,
                avoid get the user away only at the first glance.</p>

            <p>In this case the situation was the end of life of Openshift v2, the platform 1 used to host (for free)
                the WordPress blog. As I was not yet accepted in the program or Openshirt v3 I decided to try an
                alternative. So I had access to a static hosting and I moved all the content from Wordpress to Jekyll.
                Jekyll is a static site generator and as I described in a previous post there is nothing bad with that
                if vou use the correct tools</p>

            </div>
            <p>We wanted to create a kind of live update of the Firebase backend while the users were using the app
                avoiding to put Save button actions in order to save. The Idea is to keep the backend updated while the
                user is creating or updating any element, these are lobo items and category elements, in our
                application. So we needed to implement a system with the help of the library Angularre and the Swatch
                Angularis function to make it happen.

            <p>Ionic provide you a framework to quickly implement with your web development skills a nice native
                application. Although, not everything is provided in the framework and if you want to get native
                features working with your application you will need to add some cordova plugins to your project.</p>
